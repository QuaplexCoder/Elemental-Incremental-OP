# Elemental-Incremental

Elemental Incremental is an incremental game designed around building atoms and molecules.
The eventual goal of this game is to get every element up to Oganesson, element 118.

This game does not use ridiculously large numbers. If you want that, check out "The Unscaled Incremental," also by me.
Next mechanic will occur at 1e7 energy.
The endgame as of v1.7 is 1e10 energy.
The far endgame (for people who like to grind) as of v1.7 is 1e13 energy.
