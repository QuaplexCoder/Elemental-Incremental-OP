      v0.1 alpha: 1-11-2020: Started making this game.<br>
      v1.0 beta: 1-11-2020: Added Hydrogen Atoms (Protium). <br>
      v1.0.1 beta: 1-11-2020: Added the first Basic Atomic Upgrade. <br>
      v1.1 beta: 1-12-2020: Saving now works!<br>
      v1.2 beta: 3-16-2020: I've been revamping the code for a while, and have gotten pre-prestige to work.<br>
      v1.2.1 beta: 3-11-2022 (Yes that's 2022, not 2020): Continued to refactor the code and the 100 protium upgrade now works.<br>
      v1.3: 3-14-2022: Added neutrinos! Also added formatting options and a software license, and fixed many bugs.<br>
